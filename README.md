# Basic Rule-Based Chatbot – ChatPy

This is a **simple rule-based chatbot** written in Python for beginner-level understanding of functions, conditions, loops, and input/output.

---

## Project Goal

 **TASK 4: Build a Basic Chatbot**

- Respond to basic user input like:
  - `"hello"` → `"Hi there!"`
  - `"how are you"` → `"I'm just a bot, but I'm doing great!"`
  - `"bye"` → `"Goodbye! Have a great day!"`

---

##  Key Concepts Used

- `if-elif-else` conditions
- `functions` to handle response logic
- `loops` for continuous conversation
- `input()` and `print()` for interaction

---
